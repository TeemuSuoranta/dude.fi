Use standard HTML5 markup to create fully functional forms for WordPress

* Works with any valid HTML form. Just copy any form from any website and it will work. It's magic!
* Include forms to posts/pages with a simple shortcode
* Live preview your forms
* Automatically detects and captures fields in any HTML form. Form values are saved as standard custom fields
* It's pluggable. Add your own validation or automation with filters and action hooks.
* Submit and validate forms via AJAX
